\addblocktext{Summary}{%
Developer with five years of experience building and deploying full stack applications. I began studying web development after falling in love with web programming and security at university. Since then I have been designing and building responive tools to help users accomplish their goals. I began working with React JS three years ago and have been astonished by how easy and enjoyable it is to build responsive cross platform applications. I prefer to work on both sides of the application, balancing writing foolproof logic and designing pleasing user interfaces.
